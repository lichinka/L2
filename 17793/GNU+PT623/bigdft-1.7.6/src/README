@brief README of the BigDFT source directory

@dir
@brief
   This directory contains the source of the core project of BigDFT.

@dir ./src/convolutions
@brief
   This directory contains the source of short convolutions used inside BigDFT.

@dir ./src/convolutions-c
@brief
   C version of some optimized convolutions (using SSE instructions for instance).

@dir ./src/init
@brief
   Initialization (guess wavefunctions)

@dir ./src/linear
@brief
   Linear scaling version routines

@dir ./src/modules
@brief
   All modules of internal part of BigDFT

@dir ./src/profiling
@brief
   Old profiling routines 'should be replaced by the flib routines (see @ref FLIB_MEMORY "flib memory")

@dir ./src/tools
@brief
   Tools to analyze the outputs from BigDFT (bader, ...)

@dir ./src/tools/bader
@brief
   Bader analysis of the electronic charge density

@dir ./src/wavelib
@brief
   Contains some routines useful to handling the wavefunctions

@dir ./src/wfn_opt
@brief
   Contains routines which operates to the wavefunctions

@dir ./src/xcPSolver
@brief
   Contains the routine to calculate the exchange-correlation energy and potential using the libxc library.
@todo Remove the use of PSolver in this directory and call it xc.
