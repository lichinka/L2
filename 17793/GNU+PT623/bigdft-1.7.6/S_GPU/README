This library provides an efficient sharing of the GPUs present on an hybrid computer between several processes, MPI tasks for example.

S_GPU provides:
 * GPU virtualization: One (or more) virtual GPU per process (MPI task)
 * Scheduling and GPU sharing done by S_GPU (not by CUDA)
 * Memory transfers and computations are overlapped
 * Written in C++ CUDA, Fortran90 bindings
 * Limited intrusion in MPI applications 

Please see the file COPYING for copying conditions.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.
