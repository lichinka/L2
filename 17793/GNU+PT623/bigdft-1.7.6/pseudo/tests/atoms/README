@brief README of the non-regression tests directory for the atom program

@dir
@brief Contains initial tests using the atom program with some restrictive options.

@details
The initial import has tests for atom.f with a wide variety of chemical elements,
but only in relativistic Teter93 LDA (iXC = - 000 020 or 1, nspol=1).

Added some tests for nitrogen in polarized and nonrelativistic LDA and PBE,
as well as one test with VWN LDA, no confinement and several configurations (to compare with NIST DFT data).
