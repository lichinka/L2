# The projectors can also be specified by the user. In this case 
# we specify only 15 projections for the 6 carbon atoms. Each line
# begins with the coordinates of the projection center in fractional
# coordinates, because f= was used. For cartesian coordinates, you
# can use c=. After the two points, comes the definition of the 
# spherical harmonics with the standard quantum numbers l and mr.
