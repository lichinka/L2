  #This is a test program to verify  whether the forces are the derivative of the energy: 
  #F=-dE/dR
  #It performs the integration of the calculated forces over  5
  # random displacement (in the range [", -dx, ",",dx,"] a.u.)
  # and compares the result with the difference of the energy
  # between the final and the initial position: E2-E1 = -Integral F.dR"
  # The advantage is two fold:
  # 1) avoiding cancellation error in finite difference derivative,
  # 2) considering the forces over all atoms.

 <BigDFT> log of the run will be written in logfile: ./log.yaml
