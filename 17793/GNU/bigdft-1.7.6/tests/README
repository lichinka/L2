@brief Non-regression tests (BigDFT)

The directory tests contains the non-regression tests concerning BigDFT.

The command <tt>make check</tt> performs the series of tests:
- @subpage TESTS_DFT;
- @subpage TESTS_OVERDFT     Tests advanced features of BigDFT;
- @subpage TESTS_LIBS        Tests the internal libraries used by BigDFT;
- @subpage TESTS_TUTORIALS   Tutorials of BigDFT;
-          tests/images      Contains the images used by the html page of the tutorials;
-          tests/styles      Css stylesheets.

Test in parallel
----------------

Use the environment variable 'run_parallel' as:
<pre>
export run_parallel='mpirun -np 2'
To use a batch system, add a batch file with:
export run_parallel=...
make check
</pre>

Each internal libraries as @link FLIB @endlink have also their set of non-regression tests 
(see the directory flib/tests).
