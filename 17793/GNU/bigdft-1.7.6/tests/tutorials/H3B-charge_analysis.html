      <h1> Charge Analysis: H<sub>2</sub>O molecule</h1>

      <p>The purpose of this lesson is to introduce the concept of  partitioning of the continuous charge density obtained 
       by solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation among the atoms of the system. 
          It is done according to the Bader's "Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules",
          and then the partial charge and polarization of individual atoms are determined. 
        </p>

      <h2>Plotting charge density</h2>
<a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole_moment target="_blank">
 <img class="figure" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Water-elpot-transparent-3D-balls.png/250px-Water-elpot-transparent-3D-balls.png" width="200px" alt="water molecule" /></a> 
      <p>For a charge analysis you need the electronic charge density to be output 
       after the last wave function convergence.
      To do this, set the third number of the eleventh line of  <code>input.dft</code> to 1:
      <pre>   0    0    1  InputPsiId, output_wf, output_grid</pre>
      <p>  By setting the <code>output_grid</code> to "1" the electronic charge density is requested to be written in the
<a href=http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/cube/ target="_blank"><code>.cube</code></a> format
       (whereas "2" would mean that different scalar potentials (Hartree, ionic and local) are written as well.
        Whenever a cube file is generated, BigDFT outputs also the corresponding averaged values over xy, xz and yz  planes.
        </p>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: run BigDFT for the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule as in <a href="H2O-bader/posinp.xyz" target="_blank"><code>posinp.xyz</code></a>.
          The other files needed for this task are: 
          the pseudo-potentials <a href="H2O-bader/psppar.O" target="_blank"><code>psppar.O</code></a> and <a href="H2O-slab/psppar.H" target="_blank"><code>psppar.H</code></a>
         and the input file  <a href="H2O-bader/input.dft" target="_blank"><code>input.dft</code></a>;
           Note that a high resolution grid of <code>hgrid=0.2</code> is used here. In the following the reason of this choice will be clearified.
       </p>


   <p class="answer"> Once the calculation is terminated, make a 3D plot of the electronic charge density 
       <code>data/electronic_density.cube</code> at some isosurfaces, e.g. 0.8 ea<sub>o</sub><sup>-3</sup> 
    (you can do it with <a href=http://inac.cea.fr/L_Sim/V_Sim/index.en.html target="_blank"><code>v_sim</code></a> ).
     Draw a few cutting planes with coloured map of density.
         </p>

      <h2>Charge partitioning between atoms</h2>
<a href= http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/research/bader/ target="_blank">
 <img class="figure" src="http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/research/bader/h2o_3d.png" width="200px" alt="Bader surfaces of water molecule" /></a> 
<p>        
           If  a spatial basis set like wavelets or plane-waves is used in solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, the wavefunction belongs to the whole system but not to individual atoms.
           In this case, defining boundaries which partition the electronic charge density (and any other quantity derived from it) between the atoms 
           can be useful. Bader's theory of "atoms in molecules" seems to provide a reliable definition to this aim; It exploits the topological properties of 
           the charge density to partition the space in several regions, each one hopefully surrounding a nucleus.
          The boundary of each Bader volume  is defined as the surface through which the charge density gradient has a zero flux.
          To analyze the charge density from BigDFT we use the implementation  by
           <a href= http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/research/bader/ target="_blank"> Graeme Henkelman's group</a>
          (with some modifications); On their homepage you can find details of their algorithm as well as their freely available code.
         </p>
         <p>
         <i>Hint:</i> When not doing all-electron calculations, Bader analysis should be done with special care.
             In BigDFT the core electrons are effectively represented by pseudopotentials. If the pseudopotential is too soft, then 
             no density maximum might be found at the nucleus position and the Bader code may miss it.
             In this case producing the density file over a very dense grid mesh  can help the Bader code to capture the maxima.
              The denser grid mesh will  increase also the overall accuracy of the Bader analysis.
         </p>

      <div class="exercice">
            <p><b>Exercise</b>: run the executable <code>(bigdft-root)/src/tools/bader/bader</code>. By default it looks for the file 
         <code> electronic_density.cube</code>  in the working directory (<code>data/</code> in this case), although one can pass the 
         name of the cube file as argument (<code>bader [ cubefile ]</code>). 
         </p>
        <p class="answer">
              This post-processing program takes a while depending on the box size and grid resolution.
              Several output files are generated, including <code> dipole.dat </code> in which  
              you can see the partial charge of each atom:
</p>
<pre>
Atoms coordinates:

   2                7.3000      8.4153      8.7003                +6.00000    -7.18542    -1.18542

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p class = "answer">
Note  the net charge associated to the Oxygen and Hydrogen atoms.
The large charge transfer between the atoms makes water molecules to be dipolar.   
</p>
      </div>
<p> <i>Hint:</i>
You may want to visualize the Bader's boundaries between atoms as in the side figure. To do this use the argument <code> -p all_atom </code>
when you run <code>bader</code>, then one cube file is generated for each atom 
which has zero values at grid points do not belong to the corresponding atom.
<!which has none-zero values only at grid points assigned to the corresponding atom.>
</p>

<p>
         Indeed there is no clear boundary between atoms and therefore the results depend on the definition.
         <b>Voronoi partitioning</b>  and <b>Mulliken population charge analysis</b> are two other common methods in this context, 
           although those are not based on density analysis.
            The former is a geometrical method to assigning each elementary volume of charge to its nearest atom while the latter 
             projects the wave-function to the atomic orbitals. 
             With such an atomic-centered basis set, the charge associated to a given atom can be obtained directly from the  
           corresponding wavefunction of that atom. However, this is not quite accurate because of e.g. overlapping of the wave functions of 
           neighboring atoms.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now you calculate the partial charges from these two methods and compare the results.         
     Vonoroi analysis is possible by <code>bader</code> code  and Mulliken population charge analysis can be done in BigDFT.      
<p>

 <div class="exercice">
  <p><b>Exercise</b>: 
<p>  Run <code>bader -c voronoi</code> where using <code>-c voronoi</code> parameter means to perform the Voronoi analysis in the end.
           Compare the partial charges on each atom obtained by the two methods. 
           According to the Voronoi method, do the H atoms take some electronic charge from the O atom or give some to it?
            </p>
<p class = "answer">
               It is not surprising that Voronoi polyhedra do not contain the correct charges of atoms with covalent bonds 
               since no difference between different atomic types is considered.
		Although it may work well for ionic systems.
</p>

<p>   Run BigDFT again after you changed the eleventh line in  <code> input.dft </code> as  
</p>
<pre>
   10    0       1  InputPsiId, output_wf, output_grid
</pre>

<p> With 10 as InputPsi, BigDFT will do a Mulliken analysis once the wavefunction is converged. 
 Find the "Mulliken analysis" part in the output of BigDFT
 and compare the decomposed charge with the two other methods.
 <p class = "answer">
 In this method, you can also find the electronic charge decomposed between different orbitals and spins. 
The latter provides individual atomic magnetic moments if spin-polarized calculation is done.
 </p>
      </div>
      

      <h2>Total and partial electric dipole moments </h2>
      <img class="figure" src="H2O-bader/avg_y.png"  alt="charge density  along y axis" />
<p>
As mentioned earlier, in addition to a <code>cube</code> file, the averages along the 3 axes are also written out by BigDFT. 
In the present case you can find the file <code>electronic_density_avg_x</code>  which contains the projection of the
          electronic density along the x axis and two others along the y and z axes. 

      A plot of these averages shows how the electronic density is concentrated in each planar layer. 
                We have already determined how much negative charge is transferred from H's to O by means of the Bader method.
                A considerable dipole moment due to this charge displacement is expected. 
                 Furthermore, since the charge inside each atomic region is not regularly distributed an intra-atomic polarization
                dipole moment can be associated to each  atom.
<p>

 <div class="exercice">
  <p><b>Exercise</b>: 
<p>  Find the  "Electric Dipole Moment" of the water molecule in the output of BigDFT. </p>
<p class = "answer">
		It is 0.727 in ea<sub>o</sub> while the experimental value is 0.728 ea<sub>o</sub> (or 1.85 Debye).

<p>   Make a vectorial visualization of the intra-atomic dipole moments 
          output in <code> dipole.dat</code>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p> Do the intra-atomic polarization dipole moments sum up to the  overall dipole moment? </p>
<p class = "answer">
 In order to calculate the overall dipole moment, you should consider also
the contributions from inter-atomic charge transfer and the (pseudo) nuclei charge. These two contibutions sum up to 
 &sum;q<sub>i</sub><b>r</b><sub>i</sub>
where the core positions <b>r</b><sub>i</sub> and net charges q<sub>i</sub> are found in <code>dipole.dat</code>.
