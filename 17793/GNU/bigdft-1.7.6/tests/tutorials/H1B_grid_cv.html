      <p class="warn">This lesson has been created for current stable version. Earlier
        versions are fully capable of running this tutorial but input files may
        have to be changed according to possible earlier formats.</p>

      <h1>Basics of BigDFT: running a wavelet computation on a
        CH<sub>4</sub> molecule</h1>

      <p>The purpose of this lesson is to get familiar with basic
        variables needed to run a wavelet computation in isolated
        boundary conditions. At the end of the lesson, one can run a
        wavelet run, check the amount of needed memory and understand
        the important part of the output.</p>

      <h2>Introduction: running the code</h2>
      <p>This lesson is based on this skeleton
        <a href="CH4/input.dft" target="_blank"><code>input.dft</code></a> file. To run electronic convergence loop, BigDFT stores its parameters in an optional file named <code>input.dft</code> with all lines mandatory.</p>
      <p>Beside this input file, BigDFT requires the atomic positions
        for the studied system and optionaly the pseudo-potential files. For the
        following tutorial, a <a href="CH4/posinp.xyz" target="_blank">methane</a> molecule will be used. The position file
        is a simple XYZ file named <a href="CH4/posinp.xyz" target="_blank"><code>posinp.xyz</code></a>:</p>
      <pre>

H       -0.63169789 +0.63169789 +0.63169789</pre>
      <p>The pseudo-potential files are following the ABINIT structure
        and are of GTH or HGH types (see the <a class="external" href="http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/pseudopotentials" target="_blank">pseudo-potential file</a> page on the
        ABINIT website for several LDA and GGA files and the <a class="external"
                                                                href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cp2k/potentials/Goedecker/abinit/" target="_blank">page
          of M. Krack</a> on the CP2K server for HGH pseudo for several
        functionals). The following files may be used for this tutorial: <a
                                                                             href="CH4/psppar.C" target="_blank">psppar.C</a> and <a href="CH4/psppar.H" target="_blank">psppar.H</a>.</p>
      <p>Running BigDFT is done using the <code>bigdft</code>
        executable in a standard Unix way, the output being by default the
        standard output, it must be redirected to a file or to a pipe, like with the unix command
        <code>tee</code>:</p>
      <pre>
user@garulfo:~/CH4/$ ls
bigdft    psppar.C     psppar.H     input.dft    posinp.xyz
user@garulfo:~/CH4/$ ./bigdft | tee screenOutput
...</pre>
      <p>Warning, to run properly, the pseudo-potential files must be
        <code>psppar.XX</code> where XX is the symbol used in the position
        file. The other files can have user-defined names, as explained in <a href="H1A_first_run.html">this</a> lesson.</p>
      <p>If the code has been compiled with MPI capabilities (which is
        enabled by default), running BigDFT on several cores is as easy as run
        it as a serial job. There is no need to change anything in the input
        files. The following example shows how to run it on a Debian system
        with installed OpenMPI on a 4 core machine:</p>
      <pre>
user@garulfo:~/CH4/$ ls
bigdft    psppar.C     psppar.H     input.dft    posinp.xyz
user@garulfo:~/CH4/$ mpirun -np 4 ./bigdft | tee screenOutput
...</pre>

      <h2>The wavelet basis set, a convergence study</h2>
      <p>The wavelet is a systematic basis set (as plane waves are),
        which means than one can increase arbitrarily the accuracy of the results by varying
        some parameters.</p>
      <h3>The main grid parameters</h3>
      <img class="figure" src="Figures/CH4-grid.png" alt="visualisation of the real space mesh" />
      <h4>hgrid</h4>
      <p>The two first lines of <code>input.dft</code> are used to set
        up the basis set. In free boundary conditions, the basis set is characterised
        by a spatial expansion and a grid step, as shown in the side
        figure.</p>
      <p>There are <emph>three float values</emph> on the first line describing the
        <emph>grid steps</emph> in the three space directions (<i>i.e.</i> x, y and z). These
        values are in bohr unit and typically range from 0.3 to 0.65. The
        harder the pseudo-potential, the lower value should be set
        up. These values are called <code>hgrid</code>.</p>
      <h4>crmult, frmult</h4>
      <p>The second line contains two float values that are two
        multiplying factors. They multiply quantities that are chemical
        species dependant. The first factor is the most important since it
        describes <emph>the spatial expansion</emph> of the basis set (in
        yellow on the figure beside). Indeed the basis set
        is defined as a set of real space points with non-zero values. These points are
        on a global regular mesh and located inside spheres centered on
        atoms. The first multiplying factor is called <code>crmult</code> for
        Coarse grid Radius MULTiplier. Increasing it means that further
        spatial expansion is possible for the wavefunctions. Typical values
        are 5 to 7.</p>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: run BigDFT for the following
          values of <code>hgrid</code> and <code>crmult</code> and plot the
          total energy convergence versus <code>hgrid</code>. The final total energy
          can be retrieved at the end of the screen output, or using this command
          <code>`grep FINAL screenOutput`</code>, the value is in Hartree. A
          comprehensive explanation of the screen output
          will be given later in this tutorial.</p>
        <pre>
hgrid = 0.55bohr / crmult = 3.5
hgrid = 0.50bohr / crmult = 4.0
hgrid = 0.45bohr / crmult = 4.5
hgrid = 0.40bohr / crmult = 5.0
hgrid = 0.35bohr / crmult = 5.5
hgrid = 0.30bohr / crmult = 6.0

hgrid = 0.20bohr / crmult = 7.0</pre>
        <img class="figureR" src="Figures/CH4-cv.png" alt="Convergence rate" />
        <p class="answer">This precision plot shows the systematicity of
          the wavelet basis set: by improving the basis set, we improve the
          value of the total energy.</p>
        <pre>
hgrid = 0.55bohr / crmult = 3.5  -->  -8.025214Ht
hgrid = 0.50bohr / crmult = 4.0  -->  -8.031315Ht
hgrid = 0.45bohr / crmult = 4.5  -->  -8.032501Ht
hgrid = 0.40bohr / crmult = 5.0  -->  -8.033107Ht
hgrid = 0.35bohr / crmult = 5.5  -->  -8.033239Ht
hgrid = 0.30bohr / crmult = 6.0  -->  -8.033300Ht

hgrid = 0.20bohr / crmult = 7.0  -->  -8.033319Ht</pre>
      </div>

      <p>To go further, one can vary <code>hgrid</code> and
        <code>crmult</code> independently. This is shown in the previous
        figure with the grey line. The shape of the convergence curve shows that both these
        parameters should be modified simoultaneously in order to increase accuracy. 
	Indeed, there are two kind of errors arising from the
        basis set. The first one is due to the fact the basis set can't
        account for quickly varying wavefunctions (value of <code>hgrid</code> should
        be decreased). The second error is the fact that the wavefunctions are
        constrained to stay inside the defined basis set (output values are
        zero). In the last case <code>crmult</code> should be raised.</p>

      <h3>Fine tuning of the basis set</h3>
      <p>The multi-scale property of the wavelets is used in BigDFT and
        a two level grid is used for the calculation. We've seen previously
        the coarse grid definition using the the multiplying factor
        <code>crmult</code>. The second multiplying value on this line of the
        input file is used for the fine grid and is called
        <code>frmult</code>. Like <code>crmult</code>, it defines a factor for
        the radii used to define the fine grid region where the number of degrees of freedom
        is indeed eight times the one of the coarse grid. It allows to define region
        near the atoms where the wavefunctions are allowed to vary more
        quickly. Typical values for this factor are 8 to 10. It's worth to
        note that even if the value of the multiplier is greater than
        <code>crmult</code> it defines a smaller region due to the fact that
        the units which are associated to these radii are significantly different.</p>

      <p>The physical quantities used by <code>crmult</code> and
        <code>frmult</code> can be changed in the pseudo-potential by adding
        an additional line with two values in bohr. The two values that the
        code are using (either computed or read from the pseudo-potential
        files) are output in the following way in the screen output:</p>
      <pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------ System Properties
Atom    N.Electr.  PSP Code  Radii: Coarse     Fine  CoarsePSP    Calculated   File
Si          4      10            1.80603  0.43563  0.93364         X
 H          1      10            1.46342  0.20000  0.00000         X</pre>

      <h2>Analysing the output</h2>

      <p>The output of BigDFT is divided into four
        parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Input values are printed out, including a summary of the
          different input files (DFT calculation parameters, atom positions,
          pseudo-potential values...).</li>
        <li>Input wavefunction creation, usually called "input guess".</li>
        <li>The SCF loop itself.</li>
        <li>The post SCF calculations including the forces calculation and
          other possible treatment like a finite size effect estimation or a
          virtual states determination.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The system parameters output</h3>
      <p>All the read values from the different input files are printed
        out at the program startup. Some additional values are provided there
        also, like the memory consumption. Values are given for one process,
        which corresponds to one core in an MPI environment.</p>

     ~11*K         |     ~W+(~3)*U+P      |   ~8*D+K+W+P   |       ~W+(~3)*U+P

The overall memory requirement needed for this calculation is thus: 121 MB</pre>
      <p>In this example, the memory requirement is given for one
        process run and the peak of memory will be in the initialisation during
        the Poisson solver kernel creation, while the SCF loop will reach
        120MB during the Poisson solver calculation. For bigger systems, with
        more orbitals, the peak of memory is usually reached during the
        Hamiltonian application.</p>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: run a small utility program provided with
          BigDFT called <code>bigdft-tool</code> to estimate the memory requirement
          of a run before submitting it to the queue system of a
          super-computer. It reads the same input file than the
          <code>bigdft</code> executable, and is thus convenient to validate inputs.</p>
        <p>The executable take one mandatory argument that is the number
          of cores to run BigDFT on. Try several values from 1 to 6 and discuss
          the memory distribution.</p>
        <pre>
user@garulfo:~/CH4/$ ls
bigdft-tool    psppar.C     psppar.H     input.dft    posinp.xyz
user@garulfo:~/CH4/$ ./bigdft-tool 2
...</pre>
        <p class="answer">BigDFT distributes the orbitals over the
          available processes (the value W does not decrease anymore after 4
          processes since there are only 4 bands in our example). This means that running a parallel job with more
          processors than orbitals will result in a bad speedup. The number of cores involved in the 
	  calculation might be however increased via OMP parallelisation, as it is indicated in 
	  <a href="H2B-scalability.html">this</a> lesson.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>The input guess</h3>
      <p>The initial wavefunctions in BigDFT are calculated using the
        atomic orbitals for all the electrons of the s, p,
        d shells, obtained from the solution of the PSP self-consistent equation for the isolated atom.</p>

</pre>
      <p>The corresponding hamiltonian is then diagonalised and the
        n_band (<code>norb</code> in the code notations) lower eigenfunctions are used to start the SCF loop. BigDFT outputs the
        eigenvalues, in the following example, 8 electrons were used in the
        input guess and the resulting first fourth eigenfunctions will be used
        for a four band calculation.</p>

      <h3>The SCF loop</h3>
      <p>The SCF loop follows a direct minimisation scheme and is made of the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculate the charge density from the previous wavefunctions.</li>
        <li>Apply the Poisson solver to obtain the Hartree potential from the
          charges and calculate the exchange-correlation energy and the energy
          of the XC potential thanks to the chosen functional.</li>
        <li>Apply the resulting hamiltonian on the current wavefunctions.</li>
        <li>Precondition the result and apply a steepest descent or a DIIS
          history method (depending on the 8th line of
          <code>input.dft</code> file, the second value being the DIIS
          history length, which is usually 5 or 6 and should be put to 0 for SD
          minimisation).</li>
        <li>Orthogonalise the new wavefunctions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, BigDFT outputs a summary of the parts of the energy:</p>
      <pre>
ekin_sum,epot_sum,eproj_sum  6.84560740872E+00 -1.00862806135E+01  5.49669947400E-01

</pre>
      <p>Finally the total energy and the square norm of the residue
        (gnrm) are printed out. The gnrm value is the stopping criterion. It is
        chosen at the sixth line of the <code>input.dft</code> file. A common
        value is 1e-4 and good value can reach 1e-5.</p>
      <pre>

</pre>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: run <code>`grep "total energy" screenOutput`</code> and
          look at the convergence rate for our methane molecule.</p>
        <p class="answer">The minimisation scheme coupled with DIIS (and
          thanks to the good preconditioner) is a very efficient way to obtain
          convergence for systems with a gap, even with a very small one. Usual run
          should reach the 1e-4 stop criterion within 15 to 25
          iterations. Otherwise, there is an issue with the system, either there is no
          gap, or the input guess is too symmetric due to the LCAO diagonalization,
          specific spin polarization...</p>
      </div>

      <h3>The post-SCF treatments</h3>
      <p>At the end of the SCF loop, a diagonalisation of the current
        hamiltonian is done to obtain Kohn-Sham eigenfunctions. The
        corresponding eigenvalues are also given.</p>
      <p>The forces are then calculated.</p>
      <p>Some other post-SCF may be done depending on the
        <code>input.dft</code> file:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One can run an estimation of finite-size effects. This is
          explained in the manual (which is not yet completely updated to recent BigDFT versions).</li>
        <li>One can run a Davidson treatment on the current hamiltonian to
          obtain the energies (and virtual wavefunctions) of the first
          unoccupied levels.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: Before going further, review the
          <code>input.dft</code> file to identify the meaning of the different
          lines as explained previously.</p>
        <p class="answer">1st line, "0.450 0.450 0.450" hx, hy, hz are the

        <p class="answer">7th line, "50 10" the first value is the maximum
          number of SCF iteration and the second is the maximum number of
          restart after a fresh diagonalisation if convergence is not reached.</p>
        <p class="answer">8th line, "6 6" the second value is the length
          of the DIIS history and should be put to 0 to use SD instead.</p>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: run <code>bigdft-tool</code> when varying the
          DIIS history length and discuss the memory consumption.</p>
        <p class="answer">Reducing the DIIS history is a good way to
          reduce the memory consumption when one cannot increase the
          number of processes. Of course this implies more iterations in SCF loops.</p>

      <!--    <h2>HOMO / LUMO gap and visualisation of orbitals</h2>
              <p>BigDFT provides a Davidson method to obtain the HOMO / LUMO gap
                of molecules.</p> -->

      <h2>Adding a charge</h2>
      <p>BigDFT can treat charged system without the requirement to add
        a compensating background like in plane waves.</p>
      <p>The additional charge to add to the system is set in the
        <code>input.dft</code> file at the fourth line. In the following
        example an electron has been added (-1):</p>
      <pre>
-1 0.0 0.0 0.0 ncharge efield</pre>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: remove the last hydrogen atom in the previous
          methane example and modify <code>input.dft</code> to add an
          electron. Then run BigDFT for an electronic convergence.</p>
        <p class="answer">One can notice that the total charge in the
          system is indeed -8 thanks to the additional charge. The convergence
          rate is still good for this CH<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> radical since
          it is a closed shell system.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Running a geometry optimisation</h2>
      <p>In the previous charged example the geometry of the radical is
        kept the same than for the methane molecule, while it is likely to
        change. One can thus optimize the geometry with BigDFT.</p>
      <p>To run geometry calculations (molecular dynamics, structure
        optimisations...) one should add another input file called <a
                                                                      href="CH3-/input.geopt" target="_blank"><code>input.geopt</code></a>. The first line
        of this file contains the method to use. Here, we look for a local
        minimum so we can use the keyword <code>LBFGS</code>. The third line of
        this file contains the stopping criteria. There are two stopping
        criteria: the first being ... and the second is the maximum on
        forces. For isolated systems, the first criterion is well adapted
        while the second is good for periodic boundary conditions.</p>

      <div class="exercice">
        <p><b>Exercise</b>: take the CH<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> radical
          <code>posinp.xyz</code> file, add the <code>input.geopt</code> and run
          a geometry optimisation.</p>
        <p class="answer">The evolution of the forces during relaxation
          can be easily obtained running `grep FORCES screenOutput`. At each
          iteration, BigDFT outputs a file <code>posoutXXX.xyz</code> with the
          geometry of the iteration XXX.</p>
