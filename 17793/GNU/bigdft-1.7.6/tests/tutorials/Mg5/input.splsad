runstat new
approach SD
alphax 20.d0
fmaxtol 3.d-3
np 3
maxforcecall 350
vdtol 1.d-1
ns2 0
htol 2.d-2
hybrid yes
npneb 2
fmaxtolneb 3.d-2
#pickbestanchorpoints yes

#runstat: new or restart (default is new)
#Notice that in case of restart file "anchorposinp.xyz" must be present in the 
#current directory. You can simply rename one of anchorpoints???.xyz to it.
#fmaxtolneb: tolerance for maximum force component for NEB (default is 1.d-2)
#approach: SD or SDCG or SDDIIS or BFGS or FIRE (default is SD)
#alphax: standard step size for geometry optimization (default is 0.5)
#fmaxtol: tolerance for maximum force component of saddle point (default is 2.d-4)
#maxforcecall: maximum force call (default is 100)
#np: np-1 is the number of movable anchor points (default is 3)
#ns2: number of extra points along the path, beginning of maximization (default is 0)
#vdtol: tolerance for the derivative of potential at maximum point (default 1.d-1)
#htol: minimal distance to accept new point during maximization (default 1.d-4)
#typintpol: cubic or quintic (interpolation method for the maximization) (default is cubic)
#npneb: number of nodes during the NEB minimization (it is equal to np by default)
#hybrid: yes or no. For hybrid calculations then file ll_input.dft must be provided (default no) 
#dt: time step for FIRE method during splined saddle minimization (default 0.1d0)
#pickbestanchorpoints: yes or no. it distributes anchor point wrt energy weighting 
#(default is yes if it is a new run and it is no if it is restart run, however, it will 
#be overwritten if one uses the keywork in this file)
#doneb: yes or no. it performs NEB calculations to improve reliability and efficiency
#(default stragetgy value is similar to pickbestanchorpoints)
