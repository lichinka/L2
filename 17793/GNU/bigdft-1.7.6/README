<p>
<a href="http://bigdft.org">BigDFT</a> is a DFT massively parallel electronic structure code 
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html">GPL license</a>) using a wavelet basis set.
Wavelets form a real space basis set distributed on an adaptive mesh (two
levels of resolution in  our implementation).
</p>

<p>
GTH or HGH pseudopotentials are used to remove the core electrons.
Thanks to our Poisson solver based on a Green function formalism,  
periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with  
the proper boundary conditions.

@section L Libraries
The BigDFT code has a core part and internal components:
- The @ref FLIB "flib library" which controls the low-level operation concerning memory, timing, errors
  but provides also some tools as dictionaries objects and yaml output.
- The @ref PSOLVER "PSolver library" is devoted to the resolution of the Poisson equation.
- The @ref PSEUDO "pseudo program" is a standalone program which is used to generate the pseudopotential files.

                        like the radial distribution g(r)).

@section T Tools
- bigdft-tool  (previously called memguess): 
  read BigDFT inputs and provide an accurate estimation of memory requirement (for each CPU in case of MPI run). 
  It can also do some simple jobs (see the --help option output):
<pre>
bigdft-tool -a memory-estimation [options]:
    Performing memory estimation for a run of BigDFT.
bigdft-tool -a rotate [options]:
    Rotate the input file to use the smallest mesh possible using files
bigdft-tool -a convert-field FROM TO:
    Convert the given scalar field to another format, files FROM and TO
    are of the form <file.{etsf,cube}>.
bigdft-tool -a export-wf FILE:
    Export the compressed wavefunction from FILE to a scalar-field
    representation in Cube format.
bigdft-tool -a export-grid [options]:
    Export in XYZ format the positions of all grid points.
bigdft-tool -a atomic-wf [options]:
    Calculates the atomic wavefunctions of the first atom in the gatom
    basis.
